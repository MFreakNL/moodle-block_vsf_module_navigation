# moodle-block_vsf_module_navigation 

Introduction
============
Course module navigation is a block that show the users a summary (like a table of content) of a course with sections name and a list of all resources and activties (except URL). One objective of this block is to replace classical block navigation in a way to present only the course contents and sections title.
If you click on resources and activites of the menu, you display the page of the resource or activity.

This block use automaticaly names of sections and names of resources and activities. When you use course module navigation, we recommand to use pages to add videos or contents in order to be able to view all resources in the list of the block.
If you want to display course module navigation on all pages of the course (main, activities, resources), make sure to check permission of the block and display it on "every page".

## We add some options. Now you can

**Block Settings**
- Section name: decided if you want to show the name of the section.
- Course name: if you do not want the block to show the course name in the heading you can change it.
- Time for each activity: fill in the time that is needed to complete and/or read the module. 
- Change the setting to: On each page to show the block on the EACH module pages

**Site administration settings**
- Show this block only on module pages: set this block only to show on the module pages
- Choice you own type of completion icon: Circle or Mark
- Choice where to show the completion icon: left or right of the module name

**UPCOMING**
- Stealth mode: choice if the Navigation block should show or ignore stealth mode modules
